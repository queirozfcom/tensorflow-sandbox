       "2098  Mozilla browsers - including Firefox 1.0 - now have 7.4% of the market share, the figures suggest.While IE's market share has dropped 5% since May to 88.9%, Mozilla browsers - including Firefox - have grown by 5%.Net traffic monitor, OneStat.com, has reported that the open-source browser Firefox 1.0, released on 9 November, seems to be drawing users away from IE.Firefox is made by the Mozilla Foundation which was set up by former browser maker Netscape in 1998.\"It seems that people are switching from Microsoft's Internet Explorer to Mozilla's new Firefox browser,\" said Niels Brinkman, co-founder of Amsterdam-based OneStat.com.Microsoft IE has dominated the browser market for some time after taking the crown from Netscape, and its share of users has always stayed at around the 95% mark.Other browser software, like Opera and Apple's Safari, are also challenging Microsoft's grip on the browser market.Firefox wants to capture 10% of the market by the end of 2005.Supporters of the open-...   \n",

       "1803  An O'Gara penalty put Ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when Hickie latched onto an inside pass from Murphy and crossed for a converted try.A pair of classic outside breaks from the Ireland captain set up tries for Geordan Murphy and Peter Stringer.The only Ireland player offering a real threat was O'Driscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors.Italy led 9-8 early in the second half but Stringer's try gave Ireland a lead they never lost.Roland de Marigny took over the kicking duties for Italy from the hapless Orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge Italy into a 9-8 lead.Two moments of magic from Brian O'Driscoll guided Ireland to a workmanlike victory against Italy.It could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and Ireland drew level with a Ronan O'Gara penalty midway through the first half.Murphy, Horgan, O'Driscoll, D'Arcy, Hickie, O'Gara, Stringer, Co...   \n",
